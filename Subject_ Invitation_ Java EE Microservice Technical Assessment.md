Subject: Invitation: Java EE Microservice Technical Assessment

Dear [Candidate Name],

We are pleased to invite you to participate in our technical assessment process for the Java EE role. This assessment will help us evaluate your technical skills in developing Java EE microservices and your problem-solving abilities.

**Assessment Details:**

*   **Repository:** `https://github.com/WKimandu/java-ee-microservice-assessment.git`
*   **Exercise:** Java EE Microservice Assessment Task (Details will be in the repository's README.md)
*   **Time Limit:** [Specify Time Limit, e.g., 5 hours, 3 days] (Please clarify the intended time limit)
*   **Submission:** Via Pull Request to the `main` branch of the repository.

**Instructions for the Assessment:**

1.  **Accept Repository Invitation (if applicable):** If the repository is private, you will receive a separate invitation to collaborate. Please accept it.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the assessment repository to your local machine.
3.  **Create Your Branch:** Create a new branch from `main` for your work. Please name your branch using the format `feature/[your-name]-[assessment-date]` (e.g., `feature/john-doe-20250506`).
4.  **Understand the Task:** Carefully read the `README.md` file in the repository. It contains the detailed requirements for the assessment task, including the features to implement and any specific guidelines.
5.  **Complete the Exercise:** Implement the required features in your branch. Ensure your code is well-structured, commented where necessary, and includes appropriate tests.
    *   The project is a Maven-based Spring Boot application. You will need Java 17 and Maven installed.
    *   The previous build issues related to JPA context in tests have been resolved. The application should build cleanly using `mvn clean install`. However, there are known test failures in `AuthControllerTest` related to HTTP 401 responses that you are **not** expected to fix unless the task specifically asks you to address authentication/authorization aspects. Focus on the tasks outlined in the README.
6.  **Commit Your Work:** Commit your changes regularly with clear and descriptive messages.
7.  **Submit Your Work:** When you have completed the assessment, push your branch to the remote repository and create a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch to the `main` branch. Please ensure your PR description clearly summarizes the work you have done.

**Environment Setup:**

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 17 or higher.
*   **Apache Maven:** Version 3.6.x or higher.
*   **IDE:** Any Java IDE of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code with Java extensions).
*   **Git:** For version control.

If you encounter any issues with setting up your environment or have questions about the assessment task itself (after carefully reading the README), please reply to this email or raise an issue in the GitHub repository.

We look forward to receiving your submission.
